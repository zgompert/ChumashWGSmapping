# ChumashWGSmapping
Genomic analyses of color and survival in a selection experiment for Timema chumash based on whole genome sequence data
# Data

The DNA sequence data for this project are in `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/gompert-group4/data/t_chumash_wgs/`. There are two batches of data: batch 1 = 192 samples, batch 2 = 288 samples (some of the latter are not part of the mapping and selection experiment). See [Nosil et al. 2020](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2473271380?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals) for our analyses of GBS data from this same experiment.

**batch 1:** These samples were sequenced by GeT (Genotoul) and delivered July 2024. The IDs are at the start of the file names (Tchum-XXX, where XXX denotes the digits after 19_ in the actual file names). There are two files each of forward and reverse reads for each stick insect. 

**batch 2:** These samples were sequenced by GeT (Genotoul) and delivered October 2024. The IDs are again at the start of the file name but here are either 19_XXX (the actual ID we use) or GR806-XX for the non-experimental stick insects.
