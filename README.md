# ChumashWGSmapping
Genomic analyses of color and survival in a selection experiment for Timema chumash based on whole genome sequence data
# Data

The DNA sequence data for this project are in `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/gompert-group4/data/t_chumash_wgs/`. There are three (two so far) batches of data: batch 1 = 192 samples, batch 2 = 192 samples, batch 3 = 96 samples (some of the latter are not part of the mapping and selection experiment). See (Nosil et al. 2020)[https://www.proquest.com/docview/2473271380?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals] for our analyses of GBS data from this same experiment.
